So, when we think about things that we can do to relax and make ourselves happy, artistic endeavors are often at the top of the list. In the age of the digital, art and design are commonly associated with computers and computer programs.

#### Personalize Your Card By Uploading an Original Photo 


Now, this personalization option is very important in today’s society where people crave authenticity and a personal touch in every product they get. We’ll assume you mastered the basics of [creating a card via Cherami](http://blog.cherami.cards/blog/Step-By-Step-Guide-to-Using-Cherami-Love-Cards-Maker/), so we’ll move on to the “media upload” option.  Once you get to the point to apply an image to your card, use this option and browse through your computer folders to find just the right photo for your purpose. It could be a romantic photo of you and your loved one. It could be a goofy photo of your pet. It could also be something appropriate for any of the upcoming holidays (Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, etc.). 


Now, the most important questions: how to find the right photo for your card, if you don’t have any on your computer? 


#### Best Photo Sharing Platforms on the Web


There is a tremendous amount of websites that compile all types of images, from illustrations and vectors to professional photographs. However, with many of them there’s a “glitch”. They either sell these photos (and you can’t really afford to pay at the moment, especially not for a card that is basically a fun pastime), or they don’t have such a good selection of photos when you need something specific. 


Luckily, there’s always an evaluation squad out there that’s evaluating every single offer, software and website on the Internet, so with the help of some authority figures, we’ve compiled a list of 5 photo sharing sites that will certainly help you with your Cherami card designs. 


##### [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/)


Pixabay is this author’s favorite. It has a wide collection of quality, free-for-commercial-use photos that you don’t need to credit, so it’s very convenient for amateur users who don’t know how to cite a photo’s source. However, it’s still the best practice to give credit to original photo creators, but for something like card making, that is not very applicable. 


##### [Unsplash](https://Unsplash.com/)


This platform seems to be gaining popularity among the design community. The photos are contributed by talented photographers (both amateur and professional) and it has a large collection of HD images. 


##### [Pexels](https://Pexels.com/)

Similar to Pixabay, Pexels also offers photos that are free for commercial use, no credit required. The choice is a bit more limited that Pixabay’s, but there are many images and you can search for them by checking out the popular search suggestions: yoga, family, dinner, technology, etc. 


##### [StockSnap](https://StockSnap.io/)

Another cool site that adds hundreds of high resolution photos weekly. They provide photos under Creative Commons CC0 license, which means that you can use and modify their photos without any permissions.


##### [PicJumbo](https://PicJumbo.com/)


Last but not least, is another great resources for free images that you can freely download without restrictions. If you’re happy with their service, you can contribute with as much as you can pay, but that is not obligatory. 


There are more neat photo sharing websites that you can check out on your own, and if you get a chance, let us know in the comments what we can add to our list or mention in some future post.


Good luck creating personalized, original e-cards! We hope it helps you de-stress and relax.
