Personalize Your Card By Uploading an Original Photo

We’ll assume you mastered the basics of [creating a card via Cherami](http://blog.cherami.cards/blog/Step-By-Step-Guide-to-Using-Cherami-Love-Cards-Maker/), so we’ll move on to the “media upload” option.  Once you get to the point to apply an image to your card, use this option and browse through your computer folders to find just the right photo for your purpose.

Now, the most important questions: how to find the right photo for your card, if you don’t have any on your computer? 


Best Photo Sharing Platforms on the Web


There is a tremendous amount of websites that compile all types of images, from illustrations and vectors to professional photographs. However, with many of them there’s a “glitch”. They either sell these photos (and you can’t really afford to pay at the moment, especially not for a card that is basically a fun pastime), or they don’t have such a good selection of photos when you need something specific. 


Luckily, there’s always an evaluation squad out there that’s evaluating every single offer, software and website on the Internet, so with the help of some authority figures, we’ve compiled a list of 5 photo sharing sites that will certainly help you with your Cherami card designs. 


Pixabay


Pixabay is this author’s favorite. It has a wide collection of quality, free-for-commercial-use photos that you don’t need to credit, so it’s very convenient for amateur users who don’t know how to cite a photo’s source. However, it’s still the best practice to give credit to original photo creators, but for something like card making, that is not very applicable. 


Unsplash


This platform seems to be gaining popularity among the design community. The photos are contributed by talented photographers (both amateur and professional) and it has a large collection of HD images. 


Pexels


Similar to Pixabay, Pexels also offers photos that are free for commercial use, no credit required. The choice is a bit more limited that Pixabay’s, but there are many images and you can search for them by checking out the popular search suggestions: yoga, family, dinner, technology, etc. 


StockSnap


Another cool site that adds hundreds of high resolution photos weekly. They provide photos under Creative Commons CC0 license, which means that you can use and modify their photos without any permissions.


PicJumbo


Last but not least, is another great resources for free images that you can freely download without restrictions. If you’re happy with their service, you can contribute with as much as you can pay, but that is not obligatory. 


There are more neat photo sharing websites that you can check out on your own, and if you get a chance, let us know in the comments what we can add to our list or mention in some future post.


Good luck creating personalized, original e-cards! We hope it helps you de-stress and relax.

The human need to communicate is as old as humans themselves, but it’s taken them hundreds of thousands of years to invent putting the verbal into writing. We won’t go so far into history to explore the first written documents in stone and clay, because those documents mostly had a practical purpose - to list items for sale and communicate with traders, express religious beliefs and devotion to deities, record information about the lives of the people in those times, etc. 

However, this is also the period when first pieces of literature were conceived, including love poetry. Though romance as a concept originated much later, it appears that people had the need to express love in written form very early on. First love letters were documented a few thousand years before one of the greatest poets, Ovid, started writing his famous love poems. 

## Love Powered by Danger and Secrecy

We’ll fast forward to modern times, when great historical figures such as Beethoven, Napoleon, Lord Byron, Goethe, Tolstoy and many others left some of the most remarkable love notes for their loved ones, but also for future generations to study and marvel at them. In those examples we can see fatalistic ideas, such as not being able to live without a loved one, and we can recognize them in many popular works of art, from Shakespeare, through Romanticism, to the 20th century. 

Love letters were popular in European courts, and they were especially intense when written in secret. One of the best movies about writing secret love letters is Dangerous Liaisons, based on an 18-century French novel (which consists of letters in its entirety). It depicts the power of the written word and how it can inspire us to love, but also how it can lead us to death. Whoever underestimates the power of a love letter should do some research on how easily lives were taken because of them. 

## Advantages of the New Form of Letter Writing

Letter writing was a popular form of communication for a very long time. Even some of us can remember the time when writing letters to friends and lovers was a common practice. However, as much as we think of those times with nostalgia, we’ve let another form of written expression to take over: digital correspondence. But when you take into consideration all the advantages of sending e-mails and e-cards, you’ll see that there’s nothing to lament about. Being able to quickly craft a loving message, include a fun visual element with words, and send it instantly is a huge plus in today’s face-paced society. 

What’s more, you can make today’s popular online cards resemble any style you like. So, if you’re feeling nostalgic about the good old letter-writing times, you can make your e-card resemble a piece of paper. Or even better, you can even write out a love note on a real piece of paper in your authentic handwriting, take a photo of it with your phone, and then upload the image in a tool such as [love ecards](https://cherami.cards/love), to send it instantly to someone who’s dying to hear from you. 

In conclusion, we’d like to emphasize the importance of embracing technology and making the most of it. Regardless of the direction in which progress takes us, we’ll always have the basic human need to feel and express love.
