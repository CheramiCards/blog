How do you show affection to the people you care about - your partner, child, friend or family member? Do you buy them expensive gifts? Treat them to fancy dinners? Or, are you the type of person who knows no expensive gift can make up for the time not spent with someone you love, and you feel guilty about not being able to do more?

Well, there is a way to be with someone and show that you care even if you’re not physically present. And we don’t mean social media, because that phenomenon is slowly turning into its opposite - a way to feel even lonelier when it’s so easy to “connect”.

We mean the traditional gestures of showing affection, but dressed in modern suite - cards! And not just any old cards, but love cards created by your Cherami pals.

“Cherami” in the language of love means “Dear friend”, and so the card making app that we’re launching is imbued with a sense of love and friendship that we want to extend to everyone who uses this tool.
